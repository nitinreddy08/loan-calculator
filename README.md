Challenges Faced
The primary challenge was learning and integrating Material UI due to its steep learning curve. Initially unfamiliar with its components and styling conventions, I faced difficulties customizing the interface to meet the projectâ€™s requirements. Through dedicated effort, I overcame these challenges by exploring documentation and experimenting with components.
Learning and Improvements

Material UI: Gained proficiency by studying the official documentation, watching tutorials, and experimenting with components like Buttons, TextFields, Cards, and AppBar to create a polished interface.
API Integration: Developed hands-on experience with Axios for integrating third-party APIs, enhancing skills in real-time data fetching and response handling.
Deployment: Learned to use Vercel for seamless deployment, leveraging its GitHub integration for automatic builds.

Conclusion
This project strengthened my expertise in React, Material UI, and API integration. Overcoming challenges with Material UI and successfully deploying a fully functional app was a rewarding experience. I am eager to apply these skills to future projects and continue building impactful web applications.
