## Step-by-Step Guide:

### Clone the Project:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitinreddy08/loan-calculator
Install Dependencies:
Go to the project folder and install the required packages.

bash
Copy
cd loan-emi-calculator
npm install
Run the App Locally:
After installing the dependencies, start the app on your local machine.

bash
Copy
npm start
Deploy the App:
To make the app available online, you can deploy it using Vercel.

Connect the repository to Vercel.

Vercel will handle the deployment automatically.

Project Documentation
This app is designed to fetch live exchange rates from the ExchangeRate API and display them in a clean and user-friendly interface. It is built using React, Material UI, Context API, Axios, and deployed using Vercel.

1. Technologies Used
React: The app is built using React, which is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allowed me to create a dynamic and responsive web app that updates in real-time when the exchange rates are fetched from the API.

Material UI: For styling and layout, I used Material UI to make the app look modern and professional. It provides a set of pre-styled components that are easy to integrate and use in React applications.

Context API: I used Context API for state management to pass down data, such as the selected currency and theme (light/dark mode) across the app without needing to pass props at each level.

Axios: Axios was used to make HTTP requests to the ExchangeRate API. It allowed me to easily fetch exchange rate data from the API and manage the responses efficiently.

GitHub: I used GitHub for version control, allowing me to keep track of changes and collaborate effectively.

Vercel: Finally, I deployed the app using Vercel, which made the deployment process smooth and straightforward.

2. Features
Currency Conversion: The app allows users to convert the amount from one currency to another by selecting the base and target currencies.

Live Exchange Rates: The app fetches real-time exchange rates from the ExchangeRate API and displays them to users.

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Theme Toggle: I implemented a light/dark theme toggle, which allows users to switch between light and dark modes for better user experience.

3. Challenges Faced
One of the major challenges I faced during the development of this project was learning and working with Material UI. I had never used Material UI before, and I was not completely familiar with its components, styling conventions, or customization options. The steep learning curve of understanding how to integrate Material UI with React was something I had to work through. However, with some research and practice, I was able to successfully integrate Material UI to build the user interface.

4. Learning and Improvement
Material UI: I took time to explore the official Material UI documentation, watched tutorials, and experimented with different components to get a good understanding of how it works. I learned how to use its components like Buttons, TextFields, Cards, and AppBar to create a clean and modern interface.

API Integration: I gained hands-on experience with integrating third-party APIs into a React app using Axios. This was a valuable skill for real-time data fetching and handling API responses.

5. Deployment
I deployed the app using Vercel, which is an easy and reliable platform for React apps. Vercel allows for automatic deployment from GitHub, and I was able to get the app online with minimal setup.

6. Conclusion
This placement project helped me solidify my understanding of React, APIs, and Material UI. Despite the challenges with Material UI, I was able to overcome them and create a polished, fully functional web app. I am excited to have built this project and am looking forward to applying my skills to future projects.
